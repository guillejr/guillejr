- 👋 Hi, I’m @guillejr
- 👀 I’m interested in almost all things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic CentOS, PowerShell, Ansible, Docker, YAML, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I may be able to help with.
- 📫 I can be reached at josh.guille@outlook.com, feel free to drop me an email anytime.
      It may be a little to get back to you but I will.
